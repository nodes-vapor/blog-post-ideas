# Blog Post Ideas ⌨️
We like contributing to the community, and part of that is blogging about what we do at Nodes. You can find our engineering blog [here](https://engineering.nodesagency.com/) and the repo behind it [here](https://github.com/nodesagency/blog/).

This repo contains ideas for future blog posts written in GitHub issues. People outside of Nodes are welcome to post ideas for the team as well.

## Process
- Create an issue describing the idea/thoughts for the blog post.
- People are welcome to discuss the blog post and elaborate on the idea using the comments.
- The Nodes Vapor team will assign it to a team member for it to written, or closed if not relevant for the engineering blog. If chosen and assigned to an author, the issue should also be added to a relevant milestone (we have one milestone per year, e.g. "2017", which means that the posts are intended to be published in that year).
- When the blog post has been published, the issue will be closed with a link to the blog post.
